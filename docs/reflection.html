        <p>One of the challenges working on GitHub is learning the different codes and figuring out
            how to debug different mistakes that make the website. On WordPress I didn’t have to
            learn code but it was kind of challenging because you must do things in a certain way on
            there or it won’t work. GitHub allows me to have more creative freedom. I can easily be
            creative and design my website however I want. With WordPress, they give you layouts to
            choose from and although it may be easy, and you won’t have to do a lot of work to
            design it’s more fun to have creative freedom. On GitHub I can control the layout and
            structure of my website and I really enjoy that. WordPress does give layouts, and I can
            just choose one and put I the words/ images I want, I prefer how flexible it is to work
            on GitHub. For GitHub I needed to learn how to use HTML, CSS, and how to use GitHub. On
            WordPress I didn’t need to know much code, being that it was mainly using plug ins. I
            want to learn how to do more CSS so I can make my website be more unique. </p>
