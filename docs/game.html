        <h2>Therapy with Dr. Albert Krueger </h2>
        <p> This game is a Psychological horror and interactive game. It uses pixel art and looks
            cool and colorful. You play as Taylor(they/them) a 19 year old college student. They
            don't know why they're at the health center. Dr. Krueger is strange, he ask werid
            questions and plays games like the Rorscach Test and cups and balls. One ball had blood.
            One ball was an actually an eyebal!! The music gets louder, and there are werid sounds.
            A monster ate Tayolr at the end because I made the wrong chocies. It a fun game kind of
            werid. Since there are 3 endings i want to play again and see if I can get a better
            ending. </p>
