Focusing especially on United Productions of American (UPA), a studio whose graphic, abstract style defined the postwar period, Daniel Bashara considers animation as a laboratory exploring new models of vision and space, tracing the links--both literal and aesthetic--between animators, architects, and designers developing a midcentury modernism that rigorously reimagined the senses. Invoking the American Bauhaus legacy of László Moholy-Nagy and György Kepes, Cartoon Vision advocates for animation's pivotal role in a utopian design project of retraining the public's vision to better apprehend a rapidly changing modern world""--Provided by publisher",2019,276,,,,Cartoon vision,,University of California Press,"Oakland, California",,Library Catalog (Blacklight),NC1766.U5 B38 2019,OCLC: 1050456585,https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/25374633,,"History and criticism; Animated films; United States; Aesthetics; Art and motion pictures; Criticism, interpretation, etc; Motion pictures and architecture; United Productions of America",

Michael",The animated man: a life of Walt Disney,,978-0-520-24117-6 978-0-520-25619-4,,"""Walt Disney (1901-1966) was one of the most significant creative forces of the twentieth century, a man who made a lasting impact on the art of the animated film, the history of American business, and the evolution of twentieth-century American culture. He was both a creative visionary and a dynamic entrepreneur, roles whose demands he often could not reconcile. In his compelling new biography, noted animation historian Michael Barrier avoids the well-traveled paths of previous biographers, who have tended to portray a blemish-free Disney or to indulge in lurid speculation. Instead, he takes the full measure of the man in his many aspects. A consummate storyteller, Barrier describes how Disney transformed himself from Midwestern farm boy to scrambling young businessman to pioneering artist and, finally, to entrepreneur on a grand scale. Barrier describes in absorbing detail how Disney synchronized sound with animation in Steamboat Willie; created in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs sympathetic cartoon characters whose appeal rivaled that of the best live-action performers; grasped television's true potential as an unparalleled promotional device; and-not least-parlayed a backyard railroad into the Disneyland juggernaut.""--Publisher's description",2007,393,,,,The animated man,,University of California Press,Berkeley,,Library Catalog (Blacklight),NC1766.U52 D53155 2007,,https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/4445968,,"United States; Animators; Disney, Walt; Animateurs (Cinéma); Animatiefilms; Biographie; Biographies; Biography; Disney; États-Unis; Verenigde Staten; Walt 1901-1966",
